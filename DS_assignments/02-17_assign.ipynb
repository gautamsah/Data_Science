    "MongoDB is a database based on a non-relational document model. Thus, as a so-called NoSQL database (NoSQL = Not-only-SQL), it differs fundamentally from conventional relational databases such as Oracle, MySQL or the Microsoft SQL Server.\n",
    "The name MongoDB is derived from the English word “humongous”, which roughly means “gigantic”. MongoDB was released in 2009.\n",
    "MongoDB is a document-oriented, non-relational database that stores data in a flexible JSON-like format.\n",
    "It is designed to provide high scalability, performance, and availability, making it an excellent choice for handling large volumes of unstructured or semi-structured data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Non-relational databases, also known as NoSQL databases, are database systems that do not use the traditional table-based relational database model. Instead, they store data in a variety of structures, such as key-value pairs, documents, or graphs, making them more flexible and adaptable to different data models and use cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "There are several scenarios where MongoDB might be preferred over SQL databases:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Handling large volumes of unstructured data: MongoDB's document-based structure is well-suited for handling data that does not fit neatly into a table-based schema.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. High scalability requirements: MongoDB's architecture allows it to scale horizontally across multiple servers, making it ideal for applications that require high scalability.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Agile development: MongoDB's flexible schema makes it easier to iterate and evolve data models rapidly, making it a popular choice for agile development environments.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Real-time analytics: MongoDB's ability to handle unstructured data and provide real-time analytics makes it well-suited for applications that require real-time data analysis, such as social media platforms or IoT applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Cloud-based applications: MongoDB's architecture is designed for the cloud, making it easy to deploy and manage in cloud environments.\n",

    "The features of MongoDB are:\n",
    "- Schema-Less Database\n",
    "- Document Oriented\n",
    "- Indexing\n",
    "- Scalability\n",
    "- Replication\n",
    "- Aggregation\n",
    "- High Performance\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Schema-less Database: It is the great feature provided by the MongoDB. A Schema-less database means one collection can hold different types of documents in it. Or in other words, in the MongoDB database, a single collection can hold multiple documents and these documents may consist of the different numbers of fields, content, and size. It is not necessary that the one document is similar to another document like in the relational databases. Due to this cool feature, MongoDB provides great flexibility to databases.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Document Oriented: In MongoDB, all the data stored in the documents instead of tables like in RDBMS. In these documents, the data is stored in fields(key-value pair) instead of rows and columns which make the data much more flexible in comparison to RDBMS. And each document contains its unique object id.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Indexing: In MongoDB database, every field in the documents is indexed with primary and secondary indices this makes easier and takes less time to get or search data from the pool of the data. If the data is not indexed, then database search each document with the specified query which takes lots of time and not so efficient.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Scalability: MongoDB provides horizontal scalability with the help of sharding. Sharding means to distribute data on multiple servers, here a large amount of data is partitioned into data chunks using the shard key, and these data chunks are evenly distributed across shards that reside across many physical servers. It will also add new machines to a running database.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Replication: MongoDB provides high availability and redundancy with the help of replication, it creates multiple copies of the data and sends these copies to a different server so that if one server fails, then the data is retrieved from another server.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Aggregation: It allows to perform operations on the grouped data and get a single result or computed result. It is similar to the SQL GROUPBY clause. It provides three different aggregations i.e, aggregation pipeline, map-reduce function, and single-purpose aggregation methods\n",
    "\n",
    "- High Performance: The performance of MongoDB is very high and data persistence as compared to another database due to its features like scalability, indexing, replication, etc."
