    "In Python, an exception is an error that occurs during the execution of a program, which interrupts the normal flow of the code. When an exception occurs, Python raises an exception object, which contains information about the error, such as the type, message, and traceback.\n",
    "\n",
    "Exceptions can occur for various reasons, such as invalid inputs, division by zero, file not found, network errors, or programming errors. By handling exceptions, you can gracefully recover from errors, log them, or display user-friendly messages. To handle exceptions in Python, you can use try-except blocks, which allow you to catch and handle specific types of exceptions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Syntax errors, on the other hand, are errors that occur during the parsing of the code, before the execution starts. Syntax errors occur when the code violates the rules of the Python syntax, such as using invalid keywords, missing parentheses, or mismatched quotes. Syntax errors prevent the code from running at all and require you to fix them before the code can be executed.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main differences between exceptions and syntax errors in Python are:\n",
    "\n",
    "Cause: Exceptions are caused by runtime errors, while Syntax errors are caused by code that doesn't follow the syntax rules of the language.\n",
    "\n",
    "Occurrence: Exceptions occur during the execution of the code, while syntax errors occur during the parsing of the code.\n",
    "\n",
    "Handling: Exceptions can be handled using try-except blocks, which allow you to recover from errors and continue the program's execution. Syntax errors cannot be handled in the same way and require you to fix them before running the code.\n",
    "\n",
    "Types: Exceptions can occur for various reasons, such as input errors, network errors, or programming errors, while syntax errors occur only when the code violates the Python syntax rules.\n",
    "\n",
    "Error messages: Exceptions provide detailed error messages, including the type, message, and traceback, which can help you identify and fix the errors. Syntax errors provide simpler error messages, indicating the location and type of the error."
